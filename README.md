## Frostspark API

This is the repository for Frostspark's Plugin API.
To use Frostspark you'll need to use one of the bundled releases, or to manually compile the core binary yourself.

This is only the plugin API. Use it, if you're making a plugin that doesn't require Terraria code. If you **need** native Terraria code, consider referencing your own compiled binary (or one of the release binaries)

If you need tShock compatibility for legacy plugins, check out the [Frostspark tShock compatible API](https://github.com/Frostspark/FrostsparkTSAPI "Frostspark tShock compatible API"), which also contains instructions on porting your plugins to Frostspark.

This project is currently under construction, and isn't suitable for production use as of yet. We're still prototyping everything. Stay tuned!
